#### Bug reports

Before opening an issue, please try to reproduce on [the latest development version](https://github.com/jarun/Buku#from-source) first. The bug you noticed might have already been fixed.

If the issue can be reproduced on master, then please make sure you provide the following:
- Debug logs using the `-z` option;
- Details of operating system, Python version used, terminal emulator and shell;
- `locale` output, if relevant. It's a good idea to set your locale to UFT-8. Please refer to [Buku #131](https://github.com/jarun/Buku/issues/30).

If we need more information and there is no communication from the bug reporter within 7 days from the date of request, we will close the issue. If you have relevant information, resume discussion any time.


#### Feature requests
Please consider contributing the feature back to `Buku` yourself. Feel free to discuss. We are more than happy to help.
